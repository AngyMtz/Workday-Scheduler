In this project I attempted to complete the acceptance criteria for this week's assignment WORK DAY SCHEDULER

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

For this project I was able to complete the acceptance criteria.  My daily planner displays the current day at the tip of the calendar.  When the user scrolls down they will be presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.  When the user views the timeblocks for that day each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.  When the user clicks on a timeblock they will be able to enter an event, save that event by clicking on the save button and the info for that event will be saved in local storage so that when the page is refreshed the saved info persists.
